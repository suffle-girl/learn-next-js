// Route Group Layout ()
// route groups - good for not only to organize our project in a manner that doesn't affect the URL, but also to selectively apply a layout to a certain segments while leaving others unchanged
// we basically add the layout.tsx (the component with the inner layout) to the route group folder â†’ it affects only the parts of the app that are within this folder

// Active links - styling
// to determine if a link is active - Next js provides the usePathname hook - this hook is only working in client components - so we have to add "use client"; to the top of the component
// we can create a navLinks array, map it, and add conditionally css classes

// Templates
// are very similar to layouts - they wrap each child layout or page
// however - when user navigates between routes that share a template, a new instance of the component is mounted, DOM elements are recreated, state is not perserved, and effects are re-synchronized
// can be defined by exporting a default react component from a template.js or template.tsx file
// similar to layouts, templates should also acxept a children prop which will render the nested segments in the route
// in most cases, the layouts will be enough - but there are cases when we need to rerender the component after navigating to a different child - for example, when we use enter / exit animations for pages or when running a side effect using the useEffect hook when the route changes - in such cases, we can use templates as a replacement to layouts files
// side note - it is possible to include both, template.tsx and layout.tsx files - in such scenario, the layout gets rendered first and the children is replaced by the component exported from the template file
// templates are not a common requirement and we should primarily rely on layouts for UI - but is important to know about this
// in our case, we simply renamed the layout.tsx to template.tsx - other than that, they have the same rules and the same structure
