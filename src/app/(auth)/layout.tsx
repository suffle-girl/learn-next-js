// Route Group Layout ()
// route groups - good for not only to organize our project in a manner that doesn't affect the URL, but also to selectively apply a layout to a certain segments while leaving others unchanged
// we basically add the layout.tsx (the component with the inner layout) to the route group folder â†’ it affects only the parts of the app that are within this folder

// Active links - styling
// to determine if a link is active - Next js provides the usePathname hook - this hook is only working in client components - so we have to add "use client"; to the top of the component
// we can create a navLinks array, map it, and add conditionally css classes
