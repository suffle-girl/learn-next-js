// Nested Layouts
// layouts can of course be nested - it works in a way that the root layout gets rendered and then the layout for the component â†’ the resulting page as a footer and a header and inside it, there is a layout for eg. products
// this allows us to create layouts that apply only to a specific areas of our application
