// Navigation
// users typically rely on UI elements like links to navigate - by clicking on them, or through programmatic navigation after completing an action
// â†’ nextr provides the Link component - <Link> is a React component that extends the html <a> element, and it's the primary way to navigate between routes in Next.js
// to use it, we need to import it from "next/link" - it works the same way as in React and due to the TS types, the href props is mandatory
// dynamic routes - we can hard code them, but it not always ideal - especially when working with big chunks of data - in such case, we can pass the productId as a props to the Link component and use string interpolation
// replace prop of the Link component - replaces the current history state intead of adding a new URL - when we click back, it takes us back to the homepage instead of back to the projects
